## Requirements

* [ModLoader](https://github.com/GodotModding/godot-mod-loader) - v4+
* [ContentLoader](https://github.com/BrotatoMods/Brotato-ContentLoader) - v3.0.2+
* [Brotils](https://github.com/BrotatoMods/Brotato-Brotils/) - v1.0+

## Known Issues

These are caused by limitations with [ContentLoader](https://github.com/BrotatoMods/Brotato-ContentLoader). To fix these, ContentLoader will need to be updated, which is planned.

  - GUI - Character selection screen cuts off characters
  - GUI - Weapon selection cuts off weapons (eg *Multitasker*)
  - Feature - Custom upgrades aren't supported by ContentLoader yet (ie. the "Consumable Heal" upgrade).
  - Bug - Using multiple mods will stop the `class_bonus_effect` effect from working correctly
